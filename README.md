# CPF / CNPJ
![Build Status](https://github.com/heliohead/cpf_cnpj/actions/workflows/elixir.yml/badge.svg)

This lib does some
[CPF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadastro_de_Pessoas_F%C3%ADsicas)/[CNPJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNPJ)
facilities. It allows you to create, validate, format and generate fake CPF/CNPJ.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cpf_cnpj` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cpf_cnpj, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/cpf_cnpj>.
